    "\n",
    "* You've seen how attention is used with sequential neural networks such as RNNs. \n",
    "* To use attention with a style more late CNNs, you need to calculate self-attention\n",
    "    * where you create attention-based representations for each of the words in your input sentence. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Jane, visite, l'Afrique, en, septembre, \n",

    "* Take the word l'Afrique => A3 representation\n",
    "    * One way to represent l'Afrique would be to just look up the word embedding for l'Afrique.\n",
    "    * But depending on the context, are we thinking of l'Afrique as of a \n",
    "        * site of historical interests \n",
    "        * as a holiday destination\n",
    "        * or as the world's second largest continent\n",
    "    * Depending on context, you may choose to represent it differently\n",
    "        * A3 will look into sourrounding words, gets the context and gives the best representation\n",
    "    * It won't be too different from the attention mechanism you saw in the context of RNNs,\n",
    "        * except we'll compute these representations in parallel for all five words in a sentence\n",
    "        * the equasions are quite similar\n",
    "            * also involves a softmax\n",
    "            * exponent terms are akin to attention values\n",
    "        * the main difference is that for every word you have 3 values\n",

    "<img src='./Images/W4_04.png' style=\"width: 60%\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computations:** \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) We are going to associate each of the words with 3 values: q, k, v\n",
    "* q3 = Wq * x3  \n",
    "* k3 = Wk * x3\n",
    "* v3 = Wv * x3\n",
    "\n",
    "Wq, Wk, Wv = matrices of parameters, they allow you to pull off these query, key, and value vectors for each word\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Compute how likely each word is an answer to a certain question about a selected word\n",
    "* q3 = the question you are going to ask about the word 3: eg: what's happening ther—É?\n",
    "    * we compute the inner product between q^3 and k^1,\n",
    "    * this will tell us how good `Word 1 = Jane` answers the question of what's happening in Africa\n",
    "    * we compute the inner product between q^3 and k^2,\n",
    "    * how good `Word 2 = visite` answers the question of what's happening in Africa\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this operation is to pull up the most information that's needed to help us compute the most useful representation A^3\n",
    "\n",
    "For intuition:\n",
    "* if k^1 represents that this word is a person,\n",
    "* and k^2 represents that the second word, visite, is an action, \n",
    "* then you may find that q^3 inter producted with k^2 has the largest value, \n",
    "* and this may be intuitive example, might suggest that visite, gives you the most relevant contexts for what's happening in Africa\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Then we take all dot products for selected word and compute a soft max over them (exp(q * k) / sum(exp(q * k)) \n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Then we're going to take these Softmax values and multiply them with v^1, which is the value for word 1, the value for word 2, and so on (v)\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Finally, we sum it all up\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key advantage** of this representation is that\n",
    "* the word of l'Afrique isn't some fixed word embedding. \n",
    "* Instead, it lets the self-attention mechanism realize that l'Afrique is the destination of a visite\n",
    "* and thus compute a richer, more useful representation for this word\n",
    "\n",
    "(6) YOu do this for all words in the sequence and summarize this in one single attention, where\n",
    "* another name for this type of attention is the \"scaled dot-product attention\"\n",
    "* Q, K, V are matrices of all these qi, ki, vi values for all words\n",
    "* on the right under softmax = vectorized representation of the equation with exponents\n",
    "    * denominator = just to scale the dot-product, so it doesn't explode.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./Images/W4_05.png' style=\"width: 80%\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recap:**\n",
    "* associated with each of the five words you end up with a query, a key, and a value. \n",
    "    * The query lets you ask a question about that word, such as what's happening in Africa.\n",
    "        * Q = interesting questions about the words in a sentence,  \n",
    "    * The key \n",
    "        * K = qualities of words given a Q, \n",
    "        * looks at all of the other words, \n",
    "        * and by the similarity to the query, helps you figure out which words gives the most relevant answer to that question. \n",
    "        * In this case, visite is what's happening in Africa, someone's visiting Africa. \n",
    "    * The value \n",
    "        * V = specific representations of words given a Q\n",
    "        * allows the representation to plug in how visite should be represented within A^3, within the representation of Africa. \n",
    "* This allows you to come up with a representation for the word Africa that says this is Africa and someone is visiting Africa.\n",
    "* This is a much richer representation for the world than \n",
    "    * if you just had to pull up the same fixed word embedding for every single word \n",
    "    * without being able to adapt it based on what words are to the left and to the right of that word. "
